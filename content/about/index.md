I often find myself stuck between dilettante and polymath. Whether it is every sport on planet earth or classic french cooking techniques there is not much that does not pique my interest. I tend to believe that "specialization is for insects" and that the point of life is to get "fueled". This website is my [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), I hope to have a real garden some day.
