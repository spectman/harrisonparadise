Turn your mental prison to a maze\
Turn the maze into a place where you're safe\
We're not stepping on the graves even\
Everything will wither and decay\
But the energy will stay\
Everyday or delay, every second even\
Turn away for nothing just in case\
A sensation but it's strange\
In the way everything is a secret even-\
Call myself a vessel, not a name\
Call a taxi in the rain\
Take a plane out of space to confess, I need it\

Endlessly reflecting in your gaze\
With the mirror and it breaks\
Seven years, seven tears, seven different heavens\
Blue and black I change another shade\
And I'm trapped and in the grey\
Change the rainbow in my brain, it's a ray of colour\
Endlessly go over my mistakes\
Just to find out what it takes\
To be crazed, separate, differentiate it\
You hold on to me, the part that stays\
Makes me crawling in the wave, fly away\
But today I'll go up, I know it\

I throw all my sympathies away\
Pray my card will be a ace\
But my palm won't move a face\
I can't stand to watch it\
Everything is perfect in the void\
I don't want it to be spoiled\
I avoid it for so long, but I can't forever\
(But I can't forever)\

Endlessly reflecting in your gaze\
With the mirror and it breaks\
Seven years, seven tears, seven different heavens\
Blue and black I change another shade\
And I'm trapped and in the grey\
Change the rainbow in my brain, it's a ray of colours\
Endlessly go over my mistakes\
Just to find out what it takes\
To be crazed, separate, differentiate it\
You hold on to me, the part that stays\
Makes me crawling in the wave, fly away\
But today I'll go up, I know it\
